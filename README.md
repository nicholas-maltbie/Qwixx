# Qwixx

Qwixx is a board game made by Steffen Benndorf, more information about the 
board game can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131260/qwixx)

This is a simple GUI interface for the game and was a small project intended to 
run test cases of the game. 

Currently, this project is no longer being developed as of 10-13-2016. Although, 
the project was written with netbeans and currently has a working GUI and 
can play games. To run the game, QwixxGame.java is the main file and will 
start a GUI to play the game. 

The project is not documented but is based on the Qwixx game and plays just like 
the boar game. When run, the game creates 3 AI players who randomly make 
decisions and the rest of the human player can make choices based on how he 
and the AI players roll on their turns. Once two dice have been removed from the 
game (look at the rules [here](http://www.nsv.de/spielregeln/qwixx-classic-english.pdf) 
for more informaiton about how the game plays), the game stops progressing and 
the winner will be announced.
